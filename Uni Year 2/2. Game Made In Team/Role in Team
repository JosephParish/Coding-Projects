I was head of development and lead the planning stage as I have programmed a game on my own before (I knew what sort of classes wed need and how the inheritance structure should work generally. alongside creative decisions). 
This allowed for efficient/quick brainstorming and fast progression to development.
I had to work with some team members who did not contribute as much by picking up the slack and deligating.
We made it on time and got a good overall grade!
