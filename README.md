# Coding Projects
As a Computer Science student I want to document all my experience!                                                                                                  
I love coding and so several of these projects are done in my own spare time,                                                             
they will not be simple "write code to show I can make a variable" type stuff,                                      
most projects will serve an explicit purpose (develop understanding of html for example)!

## Projects in Uni Yr 1:

Semester 1:

  1. FibbonacciNim game (Java basics) - A simple Java game where players take coins from piles and the person to take the last coin wins 
  2. Planetary model (OOP) - A OOP Java planetary model

Semester 2:

  3. Library system (OOP) - A OOP Java book storage/organisation system
  4. Parcel delivery system (pre-exsisting code base, OOP) - Organising parcels on a network and managing their delivery on a pre-exsisting (and incomplete) code base.
  5. Machine Learning for Wine Analysis (Python, Jupyter, Pandas, ML) - Created a ML model to predict where a wine came from based on its compositional data

Personal:

  6. Primitive Blockchain (implementing and understanding Blockchain) - Create a Primitive Blockchain data structure to understand the basis for smart contracts future developments.                               
  7. Design CPU (CPU archetecture, Assembly) - Designed a simple 8-Bit CPU that could calculate fibbonacci numbers using assembly code.

## Projects in Uni Yr 2:

Semester 1:

  1. Relational Database on MySQL (SQL, Relational Databases) - Created a queryable SQL database for a described database that I normalised.
  2. 2D Game in a team (Teamwork, Java, OOP) - Working in a team of 8, Planning, Comunicating and meating deadlines whilst using github to collaborate. We did extremely well and got 80%+ on this coursework.

Semester 2:

  3. CRUD web server and client (Web, REST) - Made a Server for a client to Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete data (on mountains and their height, location, etc)
  4. NLP for grammar checking (AI, Declaritive Programing) - Made a NLP that could detect if a sentence didnt make sense or was grammatically inncorrect by looking at its composition.

Personal:

  5. Repository for Java DSA (DSA) - Create Data Structures and Algorithms from search to sort to graphs, all sorts of algorithms too. I try to contribute to this every day to practice my ability and mindset.
