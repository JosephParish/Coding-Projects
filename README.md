# Coding Projects
As a Computer Science student I want to document all my experience!                                                                                                  
I love coding and so several of these projects are done in my own spare time,                                                             
they will not be simple "write code to show I can make a variable" type stuff,                                      
most projects will serve an explicit purpose (develop understanding of html for example)!

1. FibbonacciNim game (Sem1, Java basics) - A simple Java game where players take coins from piles and the person to take the last coin wins 
2. Planetary model (Sem1, Object Oriented Programing) - A OOP Java planetary model
3. Library system (Sem2, OOP) - A OOP Java book storage/organisation system
4. Parcel delivery system (Sem2, Working on a pre-exsisting code base and OOP) - Organising parcels on a network and managing their delivery on a pre-exsisting (and incomplete) code base.
5. Make a primitive Blockchain (Done In Private, implementing and understanding Blockchain) - Input transactions into a block then a pre set private key signs off the transactions and is checked with the pre set public key. Blocks are stored in an Arraylist and have both their own and the previous hash value also requiring the current hash value having 20 0's at the begining.
