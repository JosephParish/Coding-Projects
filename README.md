# Coding Projects
As a Computer Science student I want to document all my experience!                                                                                                  
I love coding and so several of these projects are done in my own spare time,                                                             
they will not be simple "write code to show I can make a variable" type stuff,                                      
most projects will serve an explicit purpose (develop understanding of html for example)!
