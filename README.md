# Coding Projects

As a Computer Science student I want to document all my experience!                                                                                                  
I love coding and so several of these projects are done in my own spare time,                                                             
they will not be too simple and most projects will serve an explicit purpose (develop understanding of html for example)!

## Projects in Uni Yr 1:

Semester 1:

  1. FibbonacciNim game (Java basics) - A simple Java game where players take coins from piles and the person to take the last coin wins.
  2. Planetary model (OOP) - A OOP Java planetary model.

Semester 2:

  3. Library system (OOP) - A OOP Java book storage/organisation system.
  4. Parcel delivery system (pre-exsisting code base, OOP) - Organising parcels on a network and managing their delivery on a pre-exsisting (and incomplete) code base.
  5. Machine Learning for Wine Analysis (Python, Jupyter, Pandas, ML) - Created a ML model to predict where a wine came from based on its compositional data.

Personal:

  6. Primitive Blockchain (implementing and understanding Blockchain) - Create a Primitive Blockchain data structure to understand the basis for smart contracts future developments.                               
  7. Design CPU (CPU archetecture, Assembly) - Designed a simple 8-Bit CPU that could calculate fibbonacci numbers using assembly code.

## Projects in Uni Yr 2:

Semester 1:

  1. Relational Database on MySQL (SQL, Relational Databases) - Created a queryable SQL database for a described database that I normalised.
  2. 2D Game in a team (Teamwork, Java, OOP) - Working in a team of 8, Planning, Comunicating and meating deadlines whilst using github to collaborate. We did extremely well and got 80%+ on this coursework.

Semester 2:

  3. CRUD web server and client (Web, REST) - Made a Server for a client to Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete data (on mountains and their height, location, etc).
  4. NLP for grammar checking (AI, Declaritive Programing) - Made a NLP that could detect if a sentence didnt make sense or was grammatically inncorrect by looking at its composition.

Personal:

  5. Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) - Create Data Structures and Algorithms. I try to contribute to this every day. This also helps me learn new languages too (when I get to it).

## Projects in Uni Yr 3:

Semester 1:

  1. Dissertation "An AI Tool for Explainable AI" (AI, ML) - Create a tool to help specialists/scientists uses Machine learning without prior knowledge with AI assistance (for data preparation, ML pipline selection and usage).

Semester 2:



Personal:

  5. Docker and Kubernetes course (Docker, Kubernetes) - Installed, comleted demos and understood principals/architecture.
  6. Natural Language Generation web app (NLG, Fullstack Development) - Create a web app that generates text for a specific purpose, front/back end and deployed using Docker/kubernetes.
